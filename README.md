# Library Management System

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Facade design pattern for a Library Management System. The system simplifies interactions with a more complex library management backend, providing easy methods for borrowing and returning books, searching for books, and checking their availability.

## Overview

The Facade design pattern is used here to provide a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem, enhancing usability and reducing dependencies between systems. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the system might involve intricate operations which can be encapsulated to provide simplicity to the end users and systems interacting with the backend.

## Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- **LibraryFacade**: A facade class that provides simplified methods to interact with the subsystems.
- **BookInventory**: A subsystem handling book-related operations such as searching for books, checking availability, and updating inventory.
- **UserManagement**: A subsystem managing user records including updating user borrow and return actions.

The facade interacts with these subsystems to provide a unified, simplified API for client applications.

## How to Run

To run the system, ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can execute the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python library_system.py

## Notes

1. **How to Run**: Be sure to correct the filename (`library_system.py`) if it differs.
2. **Future Improvements**: These are suggestions that might help in enhancing the system's capabilities, and can be customized according to further requirements.
3. **License**: As before, ensure that the correct license type is specified and that the actual `LICENSE` file is included if applicable.

This README is crafted to ensure clarity regarding the project's purpose, structure, how to run and test it, and potential future improvements, which helps anyone new to the repository to quickly understand and use the project effectively.
